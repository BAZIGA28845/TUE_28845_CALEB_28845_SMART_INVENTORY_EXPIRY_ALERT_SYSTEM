**Student Name:** [NKURANGA BAZIGA Caleb]
**Student ID:** [28845]
**Course:** Database Development with PL/SQL (INSY 8311)

## 📌 Project Overview
[cite_start]MediSecure is a comprehensive database solution designed to solve critical challenges in Rwandan hospitals, specifically focusing on data security, unauthorized access, and slow service delivery[cite: 4, 6]. [cite_start]By replacing paper-based systems with a secure digital architecture, MediSecure combines healthcare records management with modern security features such as biometric access control and facility movement tracking[cite: 6].

## 🚩 Problem Statement
[cite_start]Many hospitals and health centers in Rwanda rely on paper files, which leads to lost records, administrative errors, and unauthorized access to sensitive patient information[cite: 4, 5]. [cite_start]Additionally, critical areas such as pharmacies and laboratories often lack sufficient monitoring to prevent misuse or theft[cite: 5].

## 🎯 Key Objectives
* [cite_start]**Secure Identification:** Implement biometric verification (fingerprint/face ID) for reliable patient and staff identification[cite: 8].
* [cite_start]**Data Protection:** Secure sensitive medical data by ensuring only authorized staff can access specific files based on their role[cite: 9, 33].
* [cite_start]**Access Monitoring:** Track and log all movements into restricted medical zones to prevent unauthorized entry[cite: 10, 36].
* [cite_start]**Service Efficiency:** Speed up patient care and decision-making by ensuring medical records are accurate, available, and safe[cite: 12, 45].

## 🛠 Technology Stack
* **Database:** Oracle 19c / 21c
