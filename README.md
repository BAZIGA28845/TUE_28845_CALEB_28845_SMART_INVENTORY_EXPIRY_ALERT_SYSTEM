**Course:** Database Development with PL/SQL (INSY 8311)

## 📌 Project Overview
MediSecure is a comprehensive database solution designed to solve critical challenges in Rwandan hospitals, specifically focusing on data security, unauthorized access, and slow service delivery.By replacing paper-based systems with a secure digital architecture, MediSecure combines healthcare records management with modern security features such as biometric access control and facility movement tracking.

## 🚩 Problem Statement
Many hospitals and health centers in Rwanda rely on paper files, which leads to lost records, administrative errors, and unauthorized access to sensitive patient information. Additionally, critical areas such as pharmacies and laboratories often lack sufficient monitoring to prevent misuse or theft.

## 🎯 Key Objectives
  ***Secure Identification:** Implement biometric verification (fingerprint/face ID) for reliable patient and staff identification.
  ***Data Protection:** Secure sensitive medical data by ensuring only authorized staff can access specific files based on their role.
  ***Access Monitoring:** Track and log all movements into restricted medical zones to prevent unauthorized entry.
  ***Service Efficiency:** Speed up patient care and decision-making by ensuring medical records are accurate, available, and safe.
