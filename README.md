## 📌 Project Overview

The **Smart Inventory Expiry Alert System** is a database-driven solution designed to help shops, pharmacies, and warehouses automatically monitor product expiry dates. The system replaces manual expiry checks with an Oracle PL/SQL–based approach that tracks product batches, detects near-expiry items, and generates timely alerts to prevent losses and protect customers.

---

## 🚩 Problem Statement

Many businesses in Rwanda rely on manual inspection of expiry labels, which is time-consuming, unreliable, and prone to human error. As a result, products often expire unnoticed, leading to financial loss, poor stock management, and customer complaints.

---

## 🎯 Key Objectives

* **Automatic Expiry Detection:** Identify product batches that are close to expiry without manual checking
* **Alert Generation:** Generate expiry notifications using PL/SQL procedures and triggers
* **Expired Stock Tracking:** Record expired products in a separate table for safe handling and reporting
* **Improved Stock Management:** Support better planning, discounts, restocking, and disposal decisions
