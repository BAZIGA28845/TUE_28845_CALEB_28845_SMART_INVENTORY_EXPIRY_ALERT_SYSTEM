# **PHASE III: LOGICAL DATABASE DESIGN**

## **Objective**

Design a well-structured **logical data model** for the Smart Inventory Expiry Alert System that accurately represents business requirements while ensuring data integrity, normalization, and support for future analytics.

---

## **Entity–Relationship (ER) Design**

The logical model identifies the main entities required to support inventory expiry management in supermarkets and shops. Each entity is clearly defined with attributes, primary keys (PK), and foreign keys (FK), and relationships reflect real-world business rules.

### **Key Entities**

* **PRODUCT** – Stores general product information
* **BATCH** – Represents product batches with manufacture and expiry dates
* **EXPIRY_ALERT** – Stores alerts generated for near-expiring products
* **EXPIRED_STOCK** – Records products that have already expired

### **Primary Relationships**

* One **PRODUCT** can have many **BATCHES**
* One **BATCH** can generate multiple **EXPIRY_ALERTS**
* One **BATCH** can appear once in **EXPIRED_STOCK**

---

## **Normalization (Up to 3NF)**

The database design follows **Third Normal Form (3NF)** to eliminate redundancy and ensure consistency:

* **1NF:** All attributes contain atomic values with no repeating groups
* **2NF:** All non-key attributes depend entirely on the primary key
* **3NF:** No transitive dependencies exist between non-key attributes

This approach improves data accuracy, reduces duplication, and simplifies maintenance.

## **Data Dictionary (Summary)**

| Table Name    | Key Attributes                                        | Purpose                     |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| PRODUCT       | product_id (PK), name, category, unit_price           | Stores product details      |
| BATCH         | batch_id (PK), product_id (FK), expiry_date, quantity | Tracks batches and expiry   |
| EXPIRY_ALERT  | alert_id (PK), batch_id (FK), alert_date, message     | Stores expiry notifications |
| EXPIRED_STOCK | expired_id (PK), batch_id (FK), expired_on            | Records expired batches     |

## **Business Intelligence Considerations**

The logical design supports BI by:

* Separating transactional and analytical data
* Enabling trend analysis on expiry dates
* Supporting aggregation for stock loss and turnover reports
* Allowing future identification of fact and dimension tables

---

## **Deliverables**

* ER Diagram (logical model)
* Data Dictionary
* Normalization justification
